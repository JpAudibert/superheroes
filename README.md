# Super Heroes

This idea was concepted after watchiing Aquaman movie.

It consists in a system built with the Rest API architecture.
In a first moment the server side is being built. Using Express, postgres and Node
the purpose is to get a way to store and manage every hero that you may think.

# Structure

The database allows the user tu insert a hero and also its kingdom, for example:

  - Aquaman -> Atlantida;
  - Superman -> Krypton;

Describing with details and images both heroes and kingdoms.

# Why I building this?

I'm continuosly trying to improve my Node skills. For this project, the purpose
is to get autonomy while using sequelize. I'm also in the way to get rid of the
tutorials and learning how to understand the documentation of these tools.
